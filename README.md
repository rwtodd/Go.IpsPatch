# Go.IpsPatch

This is a library for working with IPS files.
The format of an IPS file is described
[at zophar.net](http://www.zerosoft.zophar.net/ips.php).

Often when you run across a patch file, people want
you to install some freeware patcher, 
which is hard to trust.  Better to write my own patch program
than risk getting some kind of crypto virus :)

This library also supports writing patches in IPS format.
